            "summary": "This paper presents an enhanced protocol named PEGASIS-E, an extension of the PEGASIS (Power Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System) protocol, aimed at improving energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks. The core innovation involves using the average distance among sensor nodes for chain construction, leading to reduced energy dissipation and optimized data transmission to the base station (BS). Simulation results demonstrate that PEGASIS-E significantly extends the network's lifetime compared to the original PEGASIS protocol. The methodology includes a three-phase operation: chain construction, leader selection, and data transmission, ensuring efficient management of node resources and balanced energy consumption across the network.\n\nThe protocol leverages a model of radio energy dissipation, allowing nodes to dynamically adjust their communication based on the radio range established through the average distance among participating nodes. Performance metrics were carefully evaluated, including the number of nodes remaining active, the volume of data packets successfully transmitted to the BS, energy used per round, and the overall residual energy. Results indicate PEGASIS-E maintains a more stable network lifetime than PEGASIS, with an increase in data packets sent to the base station by 34%. Hence, PEGASIS-E offers a competitive alternative for energy-constrained sensor networks, particularly in scenarios where extended operational life is critical.",

Sensor nodes are low power, small size & cheap\n\ndevices, capable of sensing, wireless communication\n\nand computation \\[1,2\\]. Applications of wireless sensor\n\nnetwork include monitoring of harsh inhospitable,\n\nremote geographical locations like toxic urban industrial\n\nlocations or a surveillance field. Other applications may\n\ninclude office automation, robot control, smart homes,\n\ninteractive toys, identification and personalization \\[3\\].\n\nA sensor network consists of hundreds &\n\nthousands of sensor nodes deployed in a geographical\n\nregion. These nodes collectively form a high level\n\ndescription of event being sensed, which is further\n\nforwarded to a distant base station (BS), so that end\n\nuser can access the available information. Energy\n\nawareness and computational feasibility are the key\n\nparameters that need to be addressed while designing\n\nprotocols in resource constrained sensor networks.\n\nVariation in distance of nodes from BS and differences\n\nin internodal distances are primary antecedents causing\n\nunequal energy dissipation among the nodes. Thus,\n\nenergy difference among the nodes increases with time\n\nresulting in deterioration of network performance \\[4\\].\n\nPEGASIS (Power Efficient GAthering in Sensor\n\nInformation System) isa chain based protocol \\[5\\] which\n\nhas certain deficiencies like long chaining time in the\n\nprocess of greedy chain formation, inevitability of long\n\nlinks as well as abrupt death pattern of nodes in the\n\nnetwork.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have proposed\n\nnumerous improved algorithms based on PEGASIS\n\nsuch as PEG-ant \\[6\\], EEPB \\[7\\], IEEPB \\[8\\]. Among these\n\nAuthor\n\n\u03b1\n\n:Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Sharda\n\nUniversity, Greater Noida, India. e-mail: Vibha.nehra@sharda.ac.in\n\nAuthor\n\n\u03c3\n\n:Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National\n\nInstitute of Technology, Jalandhar, India.\n\ne-mail: sharmaajayk@nitj.ac.in\n\nEEPB adopts a threshold for chain formation to avoid\n\nthe formation of long links LL, but this threshold is still\n\nuncertain and complex to determine, which induces LL,\n\nif not valued appropriately \\[7\\]. Likewise, IEEPB\n\ncompares distance between the nodes twice, finds the\n\nshortest path to link two adjacent nodes & avoids the\n\nformation of LL between the neighbors \\[8\\]. The work in\n\nthis paper introduces a PEGASIS based routing protocol\n\ncalled PEGASIS-E. PEGASIS-E computes average\n\ndistance among the nodes and sets it as radio range for\n\nthe farthest node from the BS. Then, it chains all the\n\nnodes in the radio range. Further, it comparesthe\n\ndistance of all the chained nodes to find the nearest next\n\nend node to continue the chaining process. The\n\nsimulation results show that PEGASIS-E outperforms\n\nPEGASIS.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows:\n\nsection II explains the radio energy dissipation model,\n\nsection III gives the network model and assumptions\n\nused followed by section IV which describes PEGASIS-\n\nE. Section V lists the performance metrics used for the\n\nsimulation. Section VI describes the results obtained.\n\nSection VII concludes the paper.\n\nII.Radio Energy Dissipation Model\n\nIn the radio energy model \\[9, 10\\], the\n\ntransmitter dissipates energy to run the radio electronics\n\nand the power amplifier, and the receiver dissipates\n\nenergy to run the radio electronics as shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1:\n\nRadio Energy Dissipation Model\n\nHere both the free space (d2power loss) and\n\nthe multipath fading (d4power loss) channel models are\n\nused, depending on the distance between the\n\ntransmitter and receiver \\[9, 10\\]. Power control can be\n\nused to invert this loss by appropriately setting the\n\npower amplifier\u2014if the distance is less than a threshold\n\ndo\n\n, the free space model is used; otherwise, the\n\nmultipath model is used. Thus, to transmit an L-bit\n\nmessage a distance, the radio expends\n\nA\n\n\u00a920\n\n13 Global Journals Inc.

It consists of 3\n\nstages: (1) Chain construction phase, (2) leader\n\nselection phase, (3) data transmission phase.\n\na)\n\nChain Construction Phase\n\nThe algorithm uses the following steps to form a chain:\n\na)Initialize the network parameters. Determine the\n\nnumber of nodes, initial energy, BS location\n\ninformation et al. Then, the chain construction starts.\n\nb)BS broadcasts the whole network a\n\nhello\n\nmessage\n\nto obtain basic network information such as ID of\n\nnodes alive, distance of each node to BS, and\n\ndistance among the nodes.\n\nc)Set the node farthest from BS as\n\nend node\n\n, it joins\n\nthe chain first and is labeled as node 1.\n\nd)Calculate average distance between the alive\n\nnodes, Davg\n\ne)Join all the nodes to the chain which have not joined\n\nthe network and lies in the radio range.\n\nand set it as the radio range for\n\nend\n\nnode.\n\nf)Compare distance of all nodes joined in the chain to\n\ncalculate the minimum distance node.\n\ng)Set the selected node as new\n\nend node\n\n.\n\nh)Repeat steps e), f), g) till all the nodes have joined\n\nthe chain.\n\nThe chain building scenario in PEGASIS-E for a\n\nnetwork of 100 nodes randomly arranged is shown in\n\nfigure 3.\n\nFigure\n\n3\n\n:\n\nThe chain formed in PEGASIS-E\n\nb)\n\nLeader Selection Phase\n\nLeader selection in PEGASIS-E is same as that\n\nof PEGASIS \\[5\\]. Node which transmits the data from the\n\nchain is called a leader. Leader will be in some random\n\nposition\n\nj\n\non the chain. Nodes take turns transmitting to\n\nthe BS, and will use node number\n\ni\n\nmod N ( N\n\nrepresents the number of nodes) to transmit to the BS in\n\nround\n\ni.\n\nTherefore, the leader in each round of\n\ncommunication will be at a random position on the\n\nchain, for node deaths at random locations. This\n\nconcept of random node deaths on the chain ensures\n\nrobustness of the network towards failures.\n\nc)\n\nData Transmission Phase\n\nData transmission starts on successful\n\nconstruction of chain and leader node selection.

Each\n\nnode delivers its own sensed data to its neighbor node\n\nin the chain during their time slots assigned by TDMA\n\nmechanism. Then, the neighbor nodes fuse the received\n\ndata with their own data & forwards further towards the\n\nleader. One round will end until BS receives data from\n\nthe leader. In addition, it is assumed that chain is rebuilt\n\nwhen a node of the chain dies during simulation of\n\nexperiment.\n\nV.Performance Metrics\n\nThe number of Nodes Alive, number of Packets received\n\nat BS, Energy consumed per round & Total Residual\n\nEnergy of the sensor network are the performance\n\nparameters that have been used to study and evaluate\n\nthe performance of the proposed protocol.\n\n\u2022\n\nNumber of alive nodes:\n\nThis instantaneous\n\nmeasure reflects the total number of nodes and that\n\nof each type that has not yet expended all of their\n\nenergy.\n\n\u2022\n\nData Packets received at base station:\n\nIt is total\n\nnumber of data packets or messages that are\n\nreceived by the base station. This is also a measure\n\nof amount of information sent to BS from the sensor\n\nfield. This measure varies linearly for all protocols.\n\n\u2022\n\nEnergy consumed:\n\nIt measures the instantaneous\n\namount of energy being consumed in the network\n\nper round. This is simply the energy difference from\n\nthe beginning till the end of a round.\n\n\u2022\n\nNetwork residual energy:\n\nIt measures the total\n\nremaining energy of the network. It is calculated at\n\neach transmission round of the protocol.\n\nThe metrics used allow us to conclude about\n\nthe stability of the network which is the time interval from\n\nthe start of network operation until the death of the last\n\nsensor node. The lifetime of the network defined as the\n\nnumber of rounds until the last node die is simply the\n\noperational period of the network that is the period for\n\nwhich the network continues to provide information to\n\nthe BS.\n\nVI.Results And Discussions\n\nTable 1:\n\nSystem parameters value\n\nParameterValue\n\nNetwork Size100 X 100 meter2\n\nSink(50,300)\n\nNumber of Nodes100\n\nInitial Energy of Node0.50 J\n\nE50 nJ/bit\n\nelect\n\nE10 pJ/bit/m\n\nfs2\n\nE0.0013 pJ/bit/m\n\nmp\n\n4\n\nE5 nJ/bit/message\n\nfusion\n\nData Packet2000 bits\n\n\u00a920\n\n13 Global Journals Inc.

The system\n\nparameters used in the simulation are shown in the table\n\n1 \\[1,5,9, 10\\].\n\nFigure 4 :\n\nNumber of nodes a live\n\nFigure 4 depicts the number of alive nodes in\n\nthe network. It is observed that PEGASIS-E has a stable\n\nlifetime as compared to PEGASIS. The lifetime period of\n\nPEGASIS-E before the death of first node is less, but it\n\ncontinues to provide information about the sensor field\n\nfor a longer period of time. PEGASIS shows abrupt\n\ndeath of nodes due to almost same energy dissipation\n\nin all nodes, as they consume same amount of energy in\n\neach round. While in PEGASIS-E, energy dissipation is\n\ndifferent in every round. It is higher for end node.\n\nFigure 5 :\n\nNumber of Packets to BS\n\nFigure 5. indicates a clear gain of 34% in\n\nnumber of Packets sent to BS for PEGASIS-E as\n\ncompared to PEGASIS.

In most applications, sensor nodes are distributed in harsh environments and WSN nodes are power-limited, so once installed it will be difficult to charge those sensor nodes. In this article, combined with clusters, we propose a routing scheme that saves energy. First, the entire surface of the sensor is divided into parts, and then the sensor is divided by weighing the elements. Each section selects a Cluster Head (CH).Clustering is one of the common methods to maximize energy production. All sensor hubs are assembled into a number of groups in the clustering technique and each group is assigned a group head called the Cluster Head (CH). The CH absorbs high energy as they are responsible for data processing and data transmission compared to the remaining Sensor Nodes (SNs). The heads of the cluster are usually overwhelmed with a large number of sensing nodes, resulting in faster death. We propose an enhanced hierarchical routing chain-based clustering (EHRCC) algorithm based on the LEACH algorithm. The EHRCC algorithm uses E-LEACH, PEGASIS-E, LEACH-1R PEGASIS and P-LEACH algorithm to investigate the creation of clusters, cluster head choice, chain creation, as well as the data transmission mechanism. Simulation results show that, EHRCC is better consumption of energy compared to HEED, E- LEACH,E- PEGASIS In addition, we evaluate the impact of various network parameters on network efficiency and further improve its performance.\n\n[View](publication/377279775_Energy-Efficient_Enhanced_Hierarchical_Routing_Chain_Based_Clustering_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

One of the most effective common way of preserving energy in sensor nodes is clustering technique in which CH selection is of great importance. In this manuscript, an improved energy efficient clustering protocol is proposed in which chaotic mapping algorithm is clubbed along with the advanced variant of Yellow Saddle Goatfish Algorithm (YSGA). The main objective of the proposed model is to reduce the energy consumption of nodes which ultimately prolongs the lifespan of wireless network. Initially, cluster are formed in the network by selecting the nodes randomly. After this, four important parameters which included, residual energy, distance to sink, average distance to CH neighbor node and delay are taken into consideration and on the basis of these factors\u2019 fitness value is calculated by the chaotic-YSGA technique. The node whose fitness value came out to be highest of all other nodes, is selected as the CH in that particular cluster. In addition, the Huffman data compression technique is used in the proposed system to reduce energy consumption in nodes. Finally, the performance of the proposed Chaotic-YSGA model is analyzed and compared with conventional energy efficient models in MATLAB software in terms of alive node, dead nodes, throughput, residual energy, FND, HND and LND. Keywords: WSN, Energy Efficiency, CH selection, Optimization Algorithms.\n\n[View](publication/360975145_An_Energy_Efficient_Clustering_Protocol_Using_CM-YSGA_Optimization_Approach_in_WSN)\n\nShow abstract\n\n... The chain for transmitting data from the source node to the BS has been formed based on the average distance measured between the sensor nodes. Even though the network life is enhanced with the reduced energy consumption, but the chain formation required the information about the location of nodes, which results in poor network scalability with large delay in data transmission \\[27\\].

Although, the topic of energy efficiency has been well researched in conventional WSN, but it has not been extensively studied. In theresearch, Reinforcement Learning (RL) based energy-aware clustering algorithm is proposed by which the neighboring nodes in the cluster selects an appropriate Cluster Head ( CH) by observing the environmental conditions like as energy consumptionand coverage that is computed as distance from the CH to the Base Station (BS). An optimal cluster is selected by each neighboring node, which minimized the energy consumption and network lifetime. The problem of selecting an optimal CH is resolved using the RL approach. Using the RL approach, the CH having the highest reward point is selected for data communication. The results show that energy saving of 7.41%, 3.27%, 4.03%, and 2.79 % is achieved for 100, 200, 300, and 400 deployed nodes, respectively.\n\n[View](publication/349612218_An_Energy_Efficient_Reinforcement_Learning_Based_Clustering_Approach_for_Wireless_Sensor_Network)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

The minimization of the energy expended by the sensor nodes and network can be achieved either by reducing the number of communications or by controlling the topology. Thus, energy consumption can be optimized, due to several techniques, such as clustering. Clustering allows the network to be divided into a set of clusters, each of which managed by a cluster head. In a hierarchical cluster based WSN, the cluster head receives the data from its sensor members, aggregates them and sends the result to the base station, which leads to an extra overload. So, the selection of appropriate cluster head plays a very important role in conserving the energy of the sensor nodes and extend the lifetime of the network. This paper introduces an Energy-Efficient Cluster Head election and Cluster Formation algorithms for WSNs, called EECH/CF. To select cluster heads, our proposal election algorithm uses the initial and residual energy level of the sensor nodes, and efficiently creates the different clusters using an appropriate mechanism. Performance evaluation has shown a significant improvement in energy conservation and the network lifetime for EECH/CF in comparison to some existing clustering algorithms.\\\n\\\nMethods\\\nOur proposal election algorithm uses the initial and residual energy level of the sensor nodes, and efficiently creates the different clusters using an appropriate mechanism.\\\n\\\nResults and Discussion\\\nPerformance evaluation has shown a significant improvement in energy conservation and the network lifetime for EECH/CF in comparison to some existing clustering algorithms.\\\n\\\nConclusion\\\nResults show that our clustering algorithms improve the lifetime of the network as we expected. Indeed, the delay before the dead of the first node can be up to seven times longer with EECH/CF.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/359767784_EECHCF_An_Energy-Efficient_Cluster_Head_Election_and_Cluster_Formation_Algorithms_for_WSNs)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[Reliable Data Collection for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](publication/345732095_Reliable_Data_Collection_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles)\\\n\\\nChapter\\\n\\\n- Apr 2017\\\n- Lect Notes Comput Sci\\\n\\\n- [![Alexandru-Valentin Vladuta](https://c5.rgstatic.net/m/4671872220764/images/template/default/profile/profile_default_m.jpg)Alexandru-Valentin Vladuta](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandru-Valentin-Vladuta)\\\n- [Ion Bica](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Ion-Bica-54967069)\\\n- [![Victor-Valeriu Patriciu](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/322459755057153-1453891804940_Q64/Victor-Valeriu-Patriciu-2.jpg)Victor-Valeriu Patriciu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor-Valeriu-Patriciu-2)\\\n- [![Florin Pop](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/272182534209561-1441904781550_Q64/Florin-Pop-3.jpg)Florin Pop](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florin-Pop-3)\\\n\\\n[View](publication/345732095_Reliable_Data_Collection_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_Using_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles)\\\n\\\n[Detection of Defects Using GMR and Inductive Probes](publication/338158631_Detection_of_Defects_Using_GMR_and_Inductive_Probes)\\\n\\\nChapter\\\n\\\nFull-text available\\\n\\\n- Jan 2020\\\n\\\n- [![Touil Dalal](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/731331214450689-1551374357379_Q64/Touil-Dalal.jpg)Touil Dalal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Touil-Dalal)\\\n- [![Ahmed Daas](https://c5.rgstatic.net/m/4671872220764/images/template/default/profile/profile_default_m.jpg)Ahmed Daas](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmed-Daas)\\\n- [![Bachir Helifa](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/278614210826263-1443438213015_Q64/Bachir-Helifa.jpg)Bachir Helifa](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bachir-Helifa)\\\n- [![Ibn Khaldoun Lefkaier](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/278369464799237-1443379860398_Q64/Ibn-Lefkaier.jpg)Ibn Khaldoun Lefkaier](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ibn-Lefkaier)\\\n\\\nEddy current testing (ECT) is one of the most extensively used non-destructive techniques for inspecting electrically conductive materials at very high speeds that does not require any contact between the test piece and the sensor.

First, the sensing tasks and the potential sensor networks applications are explored, and a review of factors influencing the design of sensor networks is provided. Then, the communication architecture for sensor networks is outlined, and the algorithms and protocols developed for each layer in the literature are explored. Open research issues for the realization of sensor networks are also discussed.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/222534027_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[Routing Techniques in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey](publication/3436000_Routing_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\nFull-text available\\\n\\\n- Jan 2005\\\n\\\n- [![JN Al-Karaki](<Base64-Image-Removed>)JN Al-Karaki](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jn-Al-Karaki)\\\n- [![Ahmed Kamal](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Ahmed Kamal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmed-Kamal-34)\\\n\\\nWireless sensor networks consist of small nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs. We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in WSNs followed by a comprehensive survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categories based on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based, QoS-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages and performance issues of each routing technique. The article concludes with possible future research areas.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/3436000_Routing_Techniques_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks_A_Survey)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[Improved PEGASIS algorithm in wireless sensor network](publication/288446202_Improved_PEGASIS_algorithm_in_wireless_sensor_network)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\n- Jul 2008\\\n\\\n- [Y.-C.

However, there are still three deficiencies, inevitability of long link (LL) between neighboring nodes, unevenness of energy consumption distribution among nodes and too much overhead on LEADER node reelection strategy, with PEGASIS protocol. In this paper, we propose a new energy-efficient PEGASIS-based protocol called EEPB that uses distance threshold to avoid formation of LL and adjusts the frequency of LEADER node reelection to lessen overhead. Also unlike LEADER node election method used in PEGASIS, our proposed algorithm adopts the remaining energy levels of nodes and the distances between nodes and the BS (base station) to decide which node is qualified to be the LEADER of the chain. Our analysis and simulation results show that our proposed algorithm, without increase in complexity, provides more uniform energy consumption among nodes and can prolong network lifetime compared to PEGASIS.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/288446202_Improved_PEGASIS_algorithm_in_wireless_sensor_network)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[PEGASIS: Power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems](publication/285480574_PEGASIS_Power-efficient_gathering_in_sensor_information_systems)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\n- Jan 2002\\\n\\\n- [![Stephanie Lindsey](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Stephanie Lindsey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephanie-Lindsey-3)\\\n- [C.S.

This formula identifies two key parameters at the physical layer that affect the network lifetime: the channel state and the residual energy of sensors. As a result, it provides not only a gauge for performance evaluation of sensor networks but also a guideline for the design of network protocols. Based on this formula, we propose a medium access control protocol that exploits both the channel state information and the residual energy information of individual sensors. Referred to as the max-min approach, this protocol maximizes the minimum residual energy across the network in each data collection.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/236624007_On_the_Lifetime_of_Wireless_Sensor_Networks)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[PEGASIS Protocol in Wireless Sensor Network Based on an Improved Ant Colony Algorithm](publication/232629100_PEGASIS_Protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Based_on_an_Improved_Ant_Colony_Algorithm)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\n- Mar 2010\\\n\\\n- [Wenjing Guo](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Wenjing-Guo-2059136475)\\\n- [Wei Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Wei-Zhang-2163459422)\\\n- [Gang Lu](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Gang-Lu-2036660022)\\\n\\\nThis paper proposes a routing protocol for the applications of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). It is a protocol based on the PEGASIS protocol but using an improved ant colony algorithm rather than the greedy algorithm to construct the chain. Compared with the original PEGASIS, this one, PEG-ant, can achieve a global optimization. It forms a chain that makes the path more even-distributed and the total square of transmission distance much less. Moreover, in the constructing process, the energy factor has been taken into account, which brings about a balance of energy consumption between nodes. In each round of transmission, according to the current energy of each node, a leader is selected to directly communicate with the base station (BS). Simulation results have show that the proposed protocol significantly prolongs the network lifetime.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/232629100_PEGASIS_Protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Based_on_an_Improved_Ant_Colony_Algorithm)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[An improved Energy-Efficient PEGASIS-Based protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks](publication/221086378_An_improved_Energy-Efficient_PEGASIS-Based_protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks)\\\n\\\nConference Paper\\\n\\\n- Jul 2011\\\n\\\n- [Sen Feng](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Sen-Feng-69854501)\\\n- [Bing Qi](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Bing-Qi-13740730)\\\n- [Liangrui Tang](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Liangrui-Tang-13740731)\\\n\\\nEEPB (Energy-Efficient PEGASIS-Based protocol) is a chain-based protocol which has certain deficiencies including the uncertainty of threshold adopted when building a chain, the inevitability of long link (LL) when valuing threshold inappropriately and the non-optimal election of leader node. Aiming at these problems, an improved energy-efficient PEGASIS-based protocol (IEEPB) is proposed in this paper. IEEPB adopts new method to build chain, and uses weighting method when selecting the leader node, that is assigning each node a weight so as to represent its appropriate level of being a leader which considers residual energy of nodes and distance between a node and base station (BS) as key parameters. The simulation results show that IEEPB has a better performance than EEPB on balancing energy consumption and prolonging lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN).\\\n\\\n[View](publication/221086378_An_improved_Energy-Efficient_PEGASIS-Based_protocol_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[Application-specific protocol architecture for wireless networks](publication/34769747_Application-specific_protocol_architecture_for_wireless_networks)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\n- Sep 2005\\\n\\\n- [![Wendi Heinzelman](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Wendi Heinzelman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wendi-Heinzelman)\\\n\\\nThesis (Ph.

A sensor network is a large network of small sensor nodes, capable of sensing, communication, and computation. It can be deployed to sense some physical phenomenon for a wide variety of applications. During recent years, research in wireless sensor networks has become more and more active. Network protocols developed for sensor networks are of great importance to meet specific design goals of sensor networks. We present a survey of recent work addressing network protocols, including routing and information dissemination algorithms, for wireless sensor networks. We evaluate them in terms of design goals, assumptions, operation models, energy models, and performance metrics.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/4056523_A_survey_on_network_protocols_for_wireless_sensor_networks)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\nShow more\\\n\\\n[iframe](https://www.medtargetsystem.com/iframe/transition?client-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net)[iframe](https://aim-tag.hcn.health/iframe.html?client-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net&pageview-id=27f72fa0-af20-11ef-89a6-8333e671a481&stps=%7B%7D)",
