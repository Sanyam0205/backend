It emphasizes the critical role of selection mechanisms in addressing challenges like premature convergence, which can occur due to a lack of diversity within a population. The authors highlight that identifying the proper selection method is essential for maintaining population diversity across generations, ultimately influencing the efficacy of the genetic algorithm. The study aggregates significant research contributions on multiple selection techniques and outlines the comparative performance of these methods in optimizing generative outputs. The findings are presented in the context of the International Conference on Futuristic Trends in Computational Analysis and Knowledge Management, held in Greater Noida, India, in February 2015.",

Genetic algorithms are optimization search algorithms that maximize or minimizes given functions. Indentifying the appropriate selection technique is a critical step in genetic algorithm. The process of selection plays an important role in resolving premature convergence because it occurs due to lack of diversity in the population. Therefore selection of population in each generation is very important. In this study, we have reported the significant work conducted on various selection techniques and the comparison of selection techniques.\n\n**Published in:** [2015 International Conference on Futuristic Trends on Computational Analysis and Knowledge Management (ABLAZE)](/xpl/conhome/7145339/proceeding)\n\n**Date of Conference:** 25-27 February 2015\n\n**Date Added to IEEE _Xplore_:** 13 July 2015\n\n**ISBN Information:**\n\n**DOI:** [10.1109/ABLAZE.2015.7154916](https://doi.org/10.1109/ABLAZE.2015.7154916)\n\nPublisher: IEEE\n\n**Conference Location:** Greater Noida, India\n\n![](/assets/img/document/toc-icon.png) Contents\n\n* * *\n\n### I. Introduction\n\nThe focus of this paper is towards comparative analysis of different selection techniques used in genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs are \u201cadaptive heuristic search algorithms\u201d that are designed to mimic Darwin's principle of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d \\[22\\]. Which includes the following approach: individuals within a population compete for resources and the individuals that are most successful in the competition will produce offspring instead of those who didn't get success. Genes are transmitted over generations where pair of individuals get selected to produce better results/offspring in next generations \\[17\\]. Therefore, the individual that emerges out at the end is the fittest and more dominating than the weaker ones.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nSteps involved in simple genetic algorithm \\[16\\]\n\nSign in to Continue Reading\n\nAuthors\n\nFigures\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nKeywords\n\nMetrics\n\nMore Like This\n\n[Equal-Width Partitioning Roulette Wheel Selection in Genetic Algorithm](/document/6395007/)\n\n2012 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence\n\nPublished: 2012\n\n[Improved Roulette Wheel Selection-Based Genetic Algorithm for TSP](/document/7945968/)\n\n2016 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers (ICNISC)\n\nPublished: 2016\n\n[Show More](javascript:void())\n\n**References is not available for this document.**\n\n### IEEE Account\n\n- [Change Username/Password](https://www.ieee.org/profile/changeusrpwd/showChangeUsrPwdPage.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Update Address](https://www.ieee.org/profile/address/getAddrInfoPage.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n\n### Purchase Details\n\n- [Payment Options](https://www.ieee.org/profile/payment/showPaymentHome.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Order History](https://www.ieee.org/profile/vieworder/showOrderHistory.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [View Purchased Documents](/articleSale/purchaseHistory.jsp)\n\n### Profile Information\n\n- [Communications Preferences](https://www.ieee.org/ieee-privacyportal/app/ibp?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Profession and Education](https://www.ieee.org/profile/profedu/getProfEduInformation.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Technical Interests](https://www.ieee.org/profile/tips/getTipsInfo.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n\n### Need Help?\n\n- **US & Canada:** +1 800 678 4333\n- **Worldwide:** +1 732 981 0060\n\n- [Contact & Support](/xpl/contact)\n\n- [About IEEE _Xplore_](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/about-ieee-xplore)\n- [Contact Us](/xpl/contact)\n- [Help](/Xplorehelp)\n- [Accessibility](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/accessibility-statement)\n- [Terms of Use](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/terms-of-use)\n- [Nondiscrimination Policy](http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/whatis/policies/p9-26.html)\n- [Sitemap](/xpl/sitemap.jsp)\n- [Privacy & Opting Out of Cookies](http://www.ieee.org/about/help/security_privacy.html)\n\nA not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 IEEE - All rights reserved.
